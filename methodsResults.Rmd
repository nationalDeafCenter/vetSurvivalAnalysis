# Data
The data were taken from the American Community Survey 5-year sample,
from years 2013-2017. The primary variables of interest measured
veteran status, service-related deafness, and postsecondary
educational attanment.
These were measured by responses to the following survey items:
- **veteran status**: "Has this person ever served on active duty in the
  U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard?" For this study,
  veterans were those who responded "On active duty in the past, but
  not now."
- **service-related deafness**: a person was considered to have
  service-related deafness if he or she gave positive
  responses to _both_ "Is this person deaf or does he/she
  haveserious difficulty hearing?" and "Does this person have a VA
  service-connecteddisability rating?" and did not list any other
  disability (specifically,
  vision, self-care, independent living, ambulatory, or cognitive
  difficulty).
- **educational attainment**: "What is the highest degree or level of
schoolthis person has COMPLETED?" combined with "At any time IN THE
LAST 3 MONTHS, has this person attended school or college?" as an
indicator of current enrollment.

In secondary analyses, we subsets of veterans with more severe
service-related deafness, or who served in the military after
September 11, 2001. These were defined by, respectively,
- responding "70 percent or higher" (the highest category) to the question "  What is this
  personâ€™s service-connecteddisability rating?"
- responding "September, 2001 or later" to the question "When did this person serve on active duty in theU.S. Armed Forces?"
